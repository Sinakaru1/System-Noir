# System: Noir
This is a small project of mine to create a version of the Voron Trident that stayed warm, looked cool, and had plenty of motion capability for fast printing. The printer started life as a MagicPhoenix 300mm  CBT kit. It's not perfect, but I hope it gives you some inspiration for your own projects!

Only the 3D files are provided - this is not intended to be a build guide - but I have posted a rough BOM for reference:
